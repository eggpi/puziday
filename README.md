A solver for a daily [calendar tiling puzzle](https://www.puzi.com.br/products/puziday).

This demonstrates using [Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) written in Python (inspired by [this implementation](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html)) to solve a puzzle modeled as an [exact cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Detailed_example).

The repository also includes a brute-force implementation, which is much, much slower than Algorithm X.
